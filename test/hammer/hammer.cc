/**
 * This test is meant to hammer gotcha_wrap with an excessively large workload.
 * It should be linked with:
 *  -- one libmath.so that contains:
 *      - (X+1)*(Y+1) template instantiations for each Add, Mult
 *        class, which does the appropriately named math() operation on its
 *        template arguments. (e.g, Mult<5, 4>::math() == 20)
 *      - (X+1)*(Y+1) template instantiations of Neg, which we will wrap
 *        around the Add and Mult calls.  Each Neg<Y, X> instance contains a
 *        pair of function pointers that will be pointed at Add<Y, X>::math()
 *        and Mult<Y, X>::math, and functions that call those Add/Mult function
 *        pointer and negate the result.
 *  -- (X+1)*(Y+1) librefY_X.so libraries.  Each libref$y_$x.so contains:
 *      -  (X+1)*(Y+1) calls to Add<Y, X>::math(), and functions that validate
 *         whether that call returned the positive or negative result of its
 *         operation (which tells whether it was wrapped or not).
 *      - $x calls to Mult<Y, X>::math(), along with similar validation calls
 *        that are used in the Add case.
 *  -- one libwrap.so, which contains bookkeeping datastructures to collect
 *     function pointers and references to all the various Add/Mult data
 *structures, and gotcha calls to trigger wrapping.
 *
 * In summary, there are a bunch of calls across many libraries to Add<Y,
 *X>::math() and Mult<Y, X>::math() that do a simple math operation.  After
 *gotcha wrapping, they will start to return -1 * their result.
